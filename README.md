# Trivia on the rocks

This application is a recipe finder for cocktails with which the user can search by name or ingredient. There is a dropdown menu to select the desired cocktail recipe if there is more than one result. 

There is also a fun trivia section all about drinks that the user can play with while they are mixing/drinking their cocktails.

  You can find the application [here](https://andrearene.github.io/Trivia_on_the_rocks/) It was designed it to meet the following criteria:

*  An app that stores recent searches
* A way for the user to clear the search history if desired.
* An interface that is intuitive for users 
* An application that is easily scaleable and expandable
* A simple and clean interface with a responsive design that accomodates screen sizes ranging from 320px to 1920px
